        /*Create a Person class to store all the columns in the csv file.

        Create a HashMap<String, ArrayList<Person>> that maps country name to a list of people from that country.

        Loop over the HashMap and sort each list by last name.

        Override toString in the Person class to print out a nicely-formatted string
        for that person (something like "Martha Jenkins from France").

        Print out the entire HashMap at the end.

        Break your code into separate methods.

        Write the resulting HashMap to a file called "people.json" formatted as JSON.


        Optional:
        Write tests for your methods.
        Modify your compareTo method so it sorts by first name if the last names are the same.*/
